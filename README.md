# Stock-Prediction
Predicting the trends of stock prices using machine learning architecture of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

You need to enter the ticker of the company/stock. For example, Google - 'GOOGL', Tesla - 'TSLA', Reliance Industries - 'RELIANCE'. Once the ticker is entered, a dataset is created automatically containing the High price, Low price, Open price, Close price, Volume and Adj Close. Opening price of the past 10 years is visualized in the form of a graph. My source of information was yahoo, but it's an individual choice. You can even upload a csv file containing data instead of using online resources.

Then with the available data a LSTM neural network is created and trained. Then provide the date for the model to predict the price.

Finally a plot with predicted values is displayed.
